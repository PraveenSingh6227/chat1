<div class='text-justify innerpage-text'><h3>Overview: Sponsoring Your Family</h3>
<div>More than 65,000 family visas were issued in 2008 alone. The Canada family immigration visa is specifically intended for applicants who are Canadian citizens or permanent residents and who can sponsor their spouse, common-law partner, dependent child (including adopted child), or other eligible relative (such as parent or grandparent) to become a permanent resident of Canada.</div>
<h3>Partnerships Not Allowed to Apply for the Family Visa</h3>
<div>You will not be qualified for sponsorship as a conjugal partner, common-law partner, or spouse if:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<ul>
<li>He or she is below 16 years of age.</li>
<li>During the marriage, he, she, or even the sponsor is married to someone else.</li>
<li>If he or she is the spouse of another person or their common-law or conjugal partner, and has been away from the sponsor separately for a minimum of one year.</li>
<li>The sponsor arrived in Canada and applied for permanent residency during a period when he or she was a family member and eligibility for immigration requirements was assessed, but the application was not reviewed.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Three years have not passed since the sponsor became a permanent resident of Canada, and they had previously supported any other spouse, common-law partner, or conjugal partner.&nbsp;</li>
<li>The applicant's spouse, common-law partner, or dependent child may very well apply to live in Canada on humanitarian and compassionate grounds if they are not eligible to sponsor or support them under the Family Class.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Other Eligible Relatives</h3>
<div>In order to obtain a family visa for Canada, you must sponsor a spouse, common-law partner, or dependent child.&nbsp; 
When applying for a family visa to Canada, you may be in Canada or even outside of it with your spouse, partner, or dependent children. You must fulfill specific eligibility conditions in order to be eligible, as must your qualified relative. There is no need for the sponsor to request financial assistance from the Canadian government because it is their duty to support their family financially while they are residing in Canada.
<br />
&nbsp;</div>
<div>The sponsor must also fulfill certain income standards. You can even sponsor parents and grandparents under the family class program for a Canada family immigration visa. Other relatives that qualify for this visa include orphaned brothers and sisters, nephews and nieces, granddaughters and grandsons, under-18-year-olds who are not married or in a common-law relationship, and children who were either adopted outside of Canada or who plan to be adopted here.</div>

<h3><br />
Benefits</h3>
<ul>
<li>The fact that relatives who are sponsored under this category will no longer have to go through any point-based examination under the Canada points system is one of the primary advantages of applying for a Canada family visa from India.</li>
<li>Sponsored family members who are granted <a href="permanent-resident-canada.php" target="_blank">Permanent residence in Canada</a> Get the long-term right to reside, work, and study in Canada under the Family Class Program.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Family members and qualified relatives entering Canada as permanent residents are now able to work without any limitations, participate in language training programs, and get the support they need to find the perfect job.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Additionally, permanent residents are eligible for all long-term benefits, including free public healthcare, free education up until the age of 18, discounted university tuition, and other social services like Old Age Security, the Canada Pension Plan Benefits, and the Guaranteed Income Supplement.</li>
<li>Parents who have been permanent residents of Canada for three years can even seek for citizenship on a Canada-dependent visa.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<h3>Sponsorship Agreement</h3>
<div>A sponsorship agreement is essentially a contract that specifies the terms and conditions for the family member or relative who is being sponsored to <a href="how-to-immigrate-to-canada-from-india.php" target="_blank">immigrate to Canada</a>, as well as the sponsor. The sponsor of this agreement acknowledges that they are willing to support their dependent or relative for the predetermined amount of time without obtaining any form of social aid. The sponsored person is responsible for making sure they have enough money, unless your sponsored family members are very old.
&nbsp;</div>
<h3>Visa Fee</h3>
<div>The Canada family visa fees for processing must be included along with your visa application</div>
<ul>
<li>The processing fee is $475 for the primary application and $75 for the sponsor per individual.</li>
<li>The principal applicant must pay $75 for the visa application if they are under 22 years old and are a dependent child of a sponsor, an adoptive child, or an orphaned family member who is not married or in a common-law partnership.</li>

<li>A $550 visa processing fee must be paid if you are above 22 and not married, engaged, or in a common-law partnership, regardless of your age.</li>
<li>A $150 fee must be paid by a sponsored relative under the age of 22 who is not married, engaged, or in a common-law partnership.
