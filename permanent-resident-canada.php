			<div class='text-justify innerpage-text'><p>It is undeniable that, of all the major immigration hotspots in the world, Canada is the most popular. Its most promising immigration program, the Canada Permanent Resident Visa, has drawn interest from prospective immigrants as well as others. To be completely honest, these folks are motivated primarily by immigration to Canada—in fact, by everything. For understandable reasons, a notable portion of the country's migratory population aspires to get the coveted and highly sought-after Permanent Residency (PR) status and become a permanent resident. It is a well-known fact that Canada is the most popular immigration destination worldwide.</p>

<h4>What is a Permanent Resident of Canada?</h4>
<p>A person who does not hold Canadian citizenship but has been granted permission to live, work, own a business, or make investments within the country's borders is known as a Canada Permanent Resident, or Canada PR. This person is not subject to any time limits on his stay in Canada while he is in possession of a permanent resident visa. You can work for any employer in Canada, and holders of a Canada PR Visa are not required to get a work permit in order to begin employment. Similarly, entrepreneurs are free to operate any kind of business or invest in any region or portion of Canada as long as they comply with all legal and regulatory requirements. There are particular immigration programs for Canada.

Permanent residents of the country have several rights and privileges in their home country as well, even if they continue to be citizens of their home country. Practically speaking, they are entitled to all citizen privileges, with the exception of the ability to vote and own a Canadian passport. <br />

<br />
Notably, each permanent resident is issued a Permanent Resident Card (PR Card), which is a verified document attesting to his distinct status as a permanent resident of the country. Whenever the concerned officials ask to see it, he has to produce it. A person with a PR card is able to leave and return to Canada. Those who enter the nation temporarily, such as international students and/or temporary foreign workers, are not considered permanent residents of Canada and do not have the same privileges as PRs.

<h4>Citizens vs. Permanent Residents in Canada</h4>
<p>Even though they believe the rights and responsibilities of a Canadian citizen and a permanent resident are very similar, some people consistently fail to recognize the differences between the two. Indeed, it is a truth that the rights and obligations of a Canadian citizen and a permanent resident do not differ all that much. Both have an equal right to associate professionally with any business, with the exception of federal or local government (although there are various restrictions). Furthermore, permanent residents have the same ability to enlist in the country's armed forces as citizens have.

Still, compared to national citizens, permanent residents of Canada lack a number of rights. They cannot run for any type of public office, for instance, and—perhaps most importantly—they do not have the national passports. In addition, unlike citizens, permanent residents may be deported from the country in the event that they commit serious crimes on its soil. Finally, while it is true that permanent residents have the option to apply for citizenship after three years of residence in Canada, this privilege is not legally enforceable.
