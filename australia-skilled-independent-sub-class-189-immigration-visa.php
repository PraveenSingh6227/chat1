<p><br />
The permanent visa for any individual with talents in demand in the growing labor market of the country is the skilled independent visa subclass 189. Candidates are offered the permit through a Points Based System (non-sponsored). It allows holders to come to Australia provided they meet certain requirements, such as having work experience, a strong command of the English language, and qualifications for a profession that is in high demand in the well-known <strong>immigration hotspot</strong>. In order to select visa applicants who work in a field that is in great demand in Australia's domestic labor market, the permit uses a points system.
<br />
<br />

In other words, even though the skilled independent subclass 189 is intended for foreign professionals and tradespeople who lack sponsorship from an Australian recruiter or firm, a territory or state, or a family member, it is really just a points-based permanent permit or visa. The individual holding the Australia Immigration Permit (Sub-class 189 visa) is allowed to live and work anywhere in the country permanently. Importantly, the petitioners for the visa may include references to certain members of their family in their application.
