			<div class='text-justify innerpage-text'><p>There is no denying the fact that among all the major world immigration hotspots Canada immigration has got the popularity all over the world and its most promising immigration program which offers Canada PR - Canada Permanent Resident<strong> </strong>Visa has garnered attention by the would be migrants and others. Frankly speaking, it is really <strong>Canada Immigration</strong> which motivates these people the most; in fact, like any and everything. A remarkable figure of the migrants to the country want to gain the nation&rsquo;s prized and much sought after Permanent Residency (PR) status, and become its Permanent Residents, for understandable reasons. It is commonly said that Canada is world&rsquo;s number one immigration destination.</p>

<h4>What Actually Canada Permanent Resident Is?</h4>
<p>Canada Permanent Resident&nbsp;or Canada PR is essentially a person, who does not have the country&rsquo;s citizenship, but has been provided with the permission to simple reside, and/or do a job or business or invest inside the nation&rsquo;s territories, minus any kind of restrictions at all on time-period put on his stay in Canada on Permanent Resident Visa. Any employer can employ you and a <strong>Canada PR&nbsp; Visa</strong> cardholder does not need a work permit to take up a job in Canada. Likewise, businessmen can do any business or invest in any area or part of Canada by just meeting the regulatory requirements for doing such investment or starting or running such a business. There are specific Canada immigration program for skilled professionals and Businessmen&nbsp;Investors.<br />

<br />
Despite the fact that the nation&rsquo;s permanent residents carry on being their home country&rsquo;s citizens, they also enjoy certain rights &amp; privileges in Canada as well. Practically, they can enjoy all the rights of a citizen except for right to vote in elections and Canadian passport. It is another matter that in order to maintain their position as a PR, they have to satisfy certain mentioned duties involving residency. For instance, it is necessary that they reside inside the Maple Country, for at least two years out of every five years to maintain their cherished permanent standing. New regulations are in the pipeline whereby a Permanent Residence card (PR CARD) holder of Canada would be required to stay in Canada for at least 4 out of 6 years to retain residency and in addition may be required to stay for 6 months out of every 12 month period.

Significantly, every permanent resident is given what is known as the Permanent Resident Card (PR Card); it&rsquo;s the certified proof of his unique position as a permanent resident of the nation. He has to produce it whenever the involved officials ask him for it. PR card permits a person to travel outside of Canada and re-enter country. Those entering the country on a short-term basis like an international student and/or a temporary overseas worker lacks Canada&rsquo;s PR rights and is not a permanent resident.</p>
<h4>Canada Permanent Resident Vs Canada Citizens</h4>
<p>Some people over and over again fail to differentiate between a Canada Permanent Resident and a Canada Citizen even as they think the rights and obligations of these two are quite parallel. Yes, it&rsquo;s a fact that there is hardly any remarkable dissimilarity between the rights and responsibilities of a Canadian permanent resident and a Canadian citizen. Both possess the same right to get professionally associated with any company, apart from the federal or provincial administration (some checks do exist). In addition, the permanent residents much like the citizens have the right to join the nation&rsquo;s defence forces.<br />

Still, the <strong>Canada permanent residents</strong> do not have several rights, as compared to the citizens of the nation. For example, they do not have the right to vote; they cannot contest for any kind of elected office; and much more importantly, possess the nation&rsquo;s passports. Apart from this, unlike the citizens, the permanent residents could be deported from the country for grave crimes committed inside the nation&rsquo;s territories. Last but not the least, although it is fact that the permanent residents have a right to submit a submission for citizenship, post 3 years inside Canada; it is not binding.</p>
