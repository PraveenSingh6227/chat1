          <p><strong>Use the New Subclass 494 Skilled Employer Sponsored Regional Visa to relocate to Australia.!</strong></p>
          <p>The Subclass 187 Regional Sponsored Migration Scheme Visa was superseded on November 16<sup>th</sup>, 2019, with the introduction of the Subclass 494 Skilled Employer Sponsored Regional Visa.</p>
		  
		  <p>The Australian government plans to focus more foreign talent on the nation's regional areas, where there is a severe labor shortage in a number of critical occupations. The Department of Home Affairs (DHA) has introduced two novel new visas, the Subclass 491 Visa and the <strong><a href="skilled-work-regional-provisional-visa-491.php" target="_blank">Subclass 494 Visa</a></strong>, to boost immigration intake and retention in certain sectors.</p>
          <p><br />
		  
          <strong>What is the Regional Visa Sponsored by a Skilled Employer?</strong></p>
		  
		  Employers in <a href="javascript:avoid(0)"><strong>regional Australia</strong></a> can sponsor foreign skilled workers who meet local labor market conditions by using this Australia visa. This pathway allows foreign nationals to live, work, and study for a maximum of five years in a selected regional area. These individuals are qualified to fill job gaps that cannot be filled by the Australian population living in their home country.
          <p><br />
          <strong>Can a foreign skilled worker be nominated for this visa by an Australian employer?</strong></p>
			
		  <p>The 494 Subclass The Employer Sponsored stream and the Labor Agreement stream are the two subcategories of the Visa. An eligible Australian employer may designate a foreign worker under the Employer Sponsor stream for a position under the sponsoring business or an affiliated entity of such business, located in a designated regional area, in an occupation where there is a skills shortage in the local labor market. This profession is referred to as the designated skilled profession.</p>
		  
		  <p>To file a nomination application for the foreign worker, the employer must be a legally operating business in Australia, be an approved work sponsor, or have sought to become a regular business sponsor.</p>		  
          
          <p><br />
          <strong>What effect will the introduction of this visa have on the Subclass 187 Visa's validity?</strong></p>
		  
		  <p>New applications for the Subclass 187 Visa are no longer accepted as of November 16<sup>th</sup>, 2019.</p>
			
          <p><br />
          <strong>What will happen to applications for Subclass 187 Visas that are pending a DHA decision?</strong></p>
		  <p>Applications for a pending RSMS Visa that were submitted before November 16<sup>th</sup>, 2019, will still be handled in accordance with the interim plans. The DHA will then announce the visa outcome.</p>
          <p><br />
          <strong>What benefits come with a Subclass 494 visa?</strong></p>
          <ul>
		  <li>Applications for regional visas will be given priority processing, which will cut down on processing time.</li>
		  <li>Incentives for long-term residence in regional areas will be made available to immigrants.</li>
		  <li>When it comes to the eligibility of occupations, this regional visa is more expansive than non-regional visas.</li>
		  <li>The visa holder may eventually be qualified to submit an application for Australian permanent residence.</li>
          </ul>
          <p><br />
		  
          <strong>What is required for a Subclass 494 Visa?</strong></p>
          <p>To be qualified to submit an application for this visa, a candidate must:</p>
         <ul>
		  <li>Be younger than 45 years old.</li>
		  <li>Be put forward by a sponsor who has given their approval.</li>
		  <li>Possess a minimum of proficiency in the English language.</li>
		  <li>Possess the abilities, background, and credentials needed for the chosen profession.</li>
		  <li>Get a favorable skill evaluation from the appropriate evaluating body.</li>
		  <li>Satisfy the DHA's standards for character and health.</li>
		  <li>Be covered by a labor agreement that has been signed by the federal government and the nominating employer if applying under the Labor Agreement Stream.</li>
         </ul>
          <p><br />
		  
            <strong>How can one become a permanent resident through the 494 Visa?</strong></p>
          <p>If qualified, the bearer of a valid Subclass 494 visa may apply for permanent residence through the Permanent Residence (Skilled Regional) Visa (Subclass 191) after three years of residency in Australia. Successful candidates for the Subclass 191 Visa can live, work, and study anywhere in Australia permanently. They can also sign up for the public healthcare program, sponsor qualified family members for permanent residency, and eventually seek for citizenship by meeting certain requirements.
</p>
          <p>The DHA is on track to accept 25,000 new immigrants to regional Australia in 2019â€“20 with the launch of the Subclass 494 Skilled Employer Sponsored Regional Visa. With this visa, international nationals will have a very profitable chance to establish themselves financially in Australia's quaint and developed remote districts.</p>
