            <div class='text-justify innerpage-text'><p>When you use this site, for any sort of information, it does not, by design, establish advisor-client or consultant-client association between PRIMEIMMIGRATIONS and you, who is the guest/reader/user. As such an association may occur ONLY in a situation wherein an advisory/consulting charge is given to PRIMEIMMIGRATIONS IMMIGRATION. However if a visit made results in advisor-client or consultant-client relation between the two parties the client concurs with following as a part of the policy of refund involving consulting:<br />
<br />
An advisor-client or consultant-client association is and will continue to be subject to a completely new contract of engagement (COE) decided and inked between both the parties, namely, PRIMEIMMIGRATIONS IMMIGRATION; client. The terms &amp; conditions and refund policy of this type of an agreed and inked contract of engagement/agreement, for using the services of the immigration consultancy in its capacity as an advisor, is fully autonomous of the terms &amp; conditions of usage of the given site.<br />
<br />
Since the pact of engagement could not be the same, and may vary from one client to another, it remains the job of the guest/reader/user to present a formal request before PRIMEIMMIGRATIONS for a draft copy of, what is called the contract of engagement (COE), that carries an annexure on refund policy which will be relevant in his situation, evaluate the COE &amp; refund policy and only then settle the fee in PRIMEIMMIGRATIONS IMMIGRATION&rsquo;&nbsp;favor.<br />
<br />
The client will offer every needed information and papers, such as the English translations in an agreed form, and as sought by PRIMEIMMIGRATIONS IMMIGRATION and the involved Visa Office. It has been fully agreed upon by the said immigration consultancy on the ground of the facts and papers presented by the client. In case the furnished details is discovered to be inaccurate or fake or deficient or incorrect, and so not entertained by the concerned Immigration bodies, the immigration consultancy takes no responsibility whatsoever for the not too positive impact of the same on the result of the petition and the ensuing rejection on this basis, even as no refund shall be claimed either of the consulting charge or the amount paid to the government organizations under such situations!<br />
<br />
The mandate of PRIMEIMMIGRATIONS IMMIGRATION is restricted to suitably help the client on the instructions and the matters involving the submission and the processing of his petition for immigration permit on the basis of the phases duly instructed in the contract of engagement (COE), offered separately and inked between both the groups, and only for the phases for which fee has been given to PRIMEIMMIGRATIONS IMMIGRATION.<br />
<br />
We have no control whatsoever over an adverse modification to the existing selection criteria as given here on this site which takes place following the inking of the given deal, and where, post the inking of the given COE, there is a transformation in pass mark, or where there is a subsequent petition of fresh regulations on the petitions submitted before.<br />
<br />
Each and every appropriate government and skills evaluation agencies charge, for all stages, may undergo a change at the sole decision of the government bodies even as the PRIMEIMMIGRATIONS lacks any control whatsoever over such a declaration. The client shall settle the charges as appropriate and sought from the immigration process, to a variety of government and associated groups, and for the purpose of testing. In a situation wherein the client has made the payment, the PRIMEIMMIGRATIONS IMMIGRATION does not offer and has not offered any sort of assurance that the petition shall materialize in the client&rsquo;s favor.<br />
<br />
The client shall loyally reveal before the <strong>PRIMEIMMIGRATIONS IMMIGRATION</strong>, each and every detail involving each and every case, existing or past, cases of wrong-doings and/or conviction, and insolvency leveled against the clients and those who are dependent on him. If he does not reveal such details, and if the same is found afterwards, no refunds at all of the money given to the immigration consultancy in question will be made.<br />
<br />
The client must offer, inside 30 days, each and every paper, forms and facts that will make it possible for the immigration consultancy in question to present his petition for skills appraisal with the applicable appraisal organization. The client&rsquo;s inability to do the same will only suggest that no reimbursement of the advisory/consulting fee offered to the PRIMEIMMIGRATIONS IMMIGRATION is outstanding.<br />
<br />
Client will notify the PRIMEIMMIGRATIONS IMMIGRATION of each and every communication received by him from the processing visa office-in writing or via phone-inside a week of the receiving of such a message. Besides, the client shall notify the said immigration consultancy of each and every communication both via written matter and via phone-undertaken by the Client, straight with the involved visa bureau inside a week or 7 days of such a contact. This comprises personal visits made to the visa bureau, and/or inquiry made, via phone. The client&rsquo;s inability to do the same will only suggest that no money back whatsoever is outstanding of any advisory charges offered to the immigration consultancy.<br />
<br />
The client will participate in each and every interview, as and when needed by the concerned processing visa agency, at the place mentioned by the visa agency, and at his own cost, and swiftly follow each and every given order as given by the visa agency. The client&rsquo;s inability to do the same will only suggest that no refund whatsoever is outstanding of any advisory charges offered to <strong>PRIMEIMMIGRATIONS IMMIGRATION</strong>.<br />
<br />
The client shall show the possession of the required liquid funds prior to the issuance of the permit, or at any given time period during the processing of the petition, in agreement with the requirements of the visa policy of the Government of Australia on the settlement funds.

<br />
The client will settle all charges, which could be owed to a variety of government and skills appraisal bodies and language testing organizations, such as but not restricted to the skills appraisal costs, residency visa petition costs, the IELTS test, health tests, etc. The given charges are strictly non-returnable and not adjustable by either any of the receiving offices or the immigration consultancy, notwithstanding the final conclusion on the visa petition. A favorable appraisal or conclusion is the sole prerogative of the involved organization even as the immigration consultancy exercises no control at all over the final outcomes at any phase of the visa petition. <strong>PRIMEIMMIGRATIONS IMMIGRATION</strong> has given no assurance whatever of a favorable appraisal or end result of the projected petition of the client for any phase.<br />
<br />
The client will inform <strong>PRIMEIMMIGRATIONS IMMIGRATION</strong> about every news involving a change of housing/mailing address, educational/specialized credentials, change of matrimonial position/ service or company, newly born kids or any police/unlawful case-after the submission of the petition, and while the processing is going on till the time of the discharge of Permanent Resident Permit. The client&rsquo;s inability to do the same will only show that no refund at all is outstanding of any advisory charges given to the immigration consultancy.<br />
<br />
The client will appear for an IELTS Test and achieve a minimum individual total of group in every given four appraisal factors read, write, speak &amp; listen as appropriate for him and as per the pre-decided COE with <strong>PRIMEIMMIGRATIONS IMMIGRATION</strong>. The client thoroughly realizes and concurs that his petition cannot be submitted minus the necessary IELTS total and no reimbursement of the advisory/consulting charges offered to PRIMEIMMIGRATIONS will be outstanding or settled, in a situation wherein he fails to attain the required IELTS total.<br />
<br />
The client shall also make certain that in case married the other half appears for an IELTS test and offers a report with minimum score as is appropriate on the basis of the decided COE with PRIMEIMMIGRATIONS. The client fully understands and concurs that his petition cannot be presented, minus the needed IELTS points of the marital partner even while no compensation of the advisory/consulting charges given to <strong>PRIMEIMMIGRATIONS IMMIGRATION</strong> will be claimed or made in a situation wherein he fails to receive the COE prescribed IELTS total of the marital partner. The said test together with the associated report is necessary towards the documentation for wedded clients, though the client may not ask for points for the qualifications of his partner.<br />
<br />
The advisory/consulting charges given to the PRIMEIMMIGRATIONS IMMIGRATION does not comprise any amount owed to any organization of the government, and to any language testing group or for any other reason, and shall be restricted to the services and duties of the immigration consultancy as duly set and decided under the COE inked separately with the client.<br />

Any online payment will not contain fee owed to such global authorized assignees and in each and every situation will not be given back.<br />
<br />
The client clearly accepts that he has been apprised of the usual waiting durations/average processing time, as appropriate to his permit class, and further that such waiting durations/usual processing time solely depends on the convenience of processing visa office/appraisal body. The client also fully agrees and realizes that he will never have any claims whatsoever on any sort of refund of the charges made on or off-site, on the ground of the extended petition processing time periods.<br />
<br />
PRIMEIMMIGRATIONS IMMIGRATION has not offered any sort of assurance, advice or pledge on work assistance or job assurance, following an approval for permit, and after landing for any given overseas country. No compensation will be claimed of any advisory charges offered earlier to PRIMEIMMIGRATIONS IMMIGRATION by the client on the ground that PRIMEIMMIGRATIONS IMMIGRATION has been unable to offer a job guarantee abroad.<br />
<br />
In a situation wherein a clash/dispute in the matter of the payment made by client to PRIMEIMMIGRATIONS IMMIGRATION towards the COE duly inked with PRIMEIMMIGRATIONS IMMIGRATION, the responsibility of PRIMEIMMIGRATIONS IMMIGRATION in case it arises and is outstanding, either monetary or otherwise shall not surpass, and will be restricted to the charges offered to PRIMEIMMIGRATIONS IMMIGRATION as advisor/consulting charges as part of the duly inked COE.</p>
