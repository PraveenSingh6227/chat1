          <p><strong>With an Australia Family Visa, you can reunite with your loved ones.</strong></p>
          <p>In order to strengthen the economic and social cohesion of the nation, Australia has long supported family migration there and the integration of people from all ethnic backgrounds. It is a means of giving families the chance to develop as a unit and plant roots in the nation. In light of this, the Australian Department of Home Affairs provides a variety of family visa options to enable citizens and permanent residents of Australia to temporarily or permanently bring their dependant family members, parents, spouses, and children to the country. Particular sponsors for these visas are eligible citizens of New Zealand and citizens of Australia who are permanent residents.
<br />
            &nbsp;</p>
          <p>The many family visa categories listed below are available for the sponsor to select from in order to bring their dependents or family members to Australia.
:&nbsp;</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Partner visa</li>
            <li>Prospective marriage visa</li>
            <li>Parent visa</li>
            <li>Child</li>
            <li>Other family visa</li>
          </ul>
          <p><br />
            Let us go over each category of the Australian family visa in detail:<br />
            &nbsp;</p>
          <p><strong>Temporary and Permanent Visas for Partners </strong></p>
          <p>The Partner Visa for Australia, also known as Subclass 801, permits the immigration of a spouse or de facto partner who is an Australian citizen or permanent resident. </p>
          <p>Your spouse must sponsor or file your application for an Australian partner visa if they have been residents of Australia for the previous two years.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p><strong>Essential Conditions for an Australian Partner Visa</strong></p>
          <p>If you fulfill the following criteria, you can apply for an Australia partner visa.:</p>
          <ul>
		    <li>Both parties have to be at least eighteen years old.</li>
			<li>The applicant must be the Australian resident's husband, fiancé, or de facto partner.</li>
			<li>For a minimum of two years, your spouse must be able to sponsor you.</li>
			<li>It is crucial for married couples to demonstrate that their relationship has lasted longer than a year and is legitimate in accordance with Australian law.</li>
			<li>De facto partners are required to provide proof of your relationship's duration of at least 12 months.</li>
			<li>You must offer enough evidence to support the legitimacy of your relationship.</li>
			<li>must meet qualifications for character and health.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p><strong>Visa for Potential Marriage (Subclass 300)</strong></p>
          <p>Those who wish to marry a permanent resident or citizen of Australia or a citizen of New Zealand who meets the requirements can apply for an Australian prospective marriage visa. The visa is only good for nine months, during which time you have to tie the knot with your intended spouse. During these nine months, Subclass 300 holders are allowed to apply for full-time jobs or pursue independent studies at their own expense. After being married, you can apply for a partner visa, which would eventually grant you <strong>permanent residency in Australia</strong>.
</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p><strong>Qualifications for a Potential Marriage Visa:</strong></p>
          <p>In order to qualify for a Prospective Marriage Visa, you need to meet the requirements listed below.:</p>
          <ul>
		  <li>Partners must be at least eighteen years old.</li>
		  <li>You need to be engaged to a permanent resident of Australia, a citizen of that country, or a citizen of New Zealand who qualifies.</li>
		  <li>Your intended spouse or partner must sponsor your visa application.</li>
		  <li>It must be your intention to wed within the next nine months.</li>
		  <li>Fulfill the requisite standards for character and health.</li>
		  <li>Must pay off all of your outstanding debts to the Australian government, if any</li>
          </ul>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p><strong>Important Aspects of the Marriage Prospective Visa:</strong></p>
          <ul>
		  <li>The desired union has to be approved by Australian law or be lawful.</li>
		  <li>Throughout your relationship, you had to have had face-to-face interactions with your partner.</li>
		  <li>You cannot be married to someone else at the time you submit the application.</li>
		  <li>Your sincere desire to cohabitate as husband and wife is evident.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p><strong>Parent Visa (Subclass 103)</strong></p>
          <p>The qualifying parents of Australian citizens or permanent residents can reunite with their children in Australia thanks to this permanent residence visa. Your child who has established in Australia will sponsor you under the terms of the parent visa.<br />
            &nbsp;</p>
          <p>There are three additional categories for the parent visa to Australia:<br />
            &nbsp;</p>
          <p><strong>Parent Category- </strong>Parents or other family members may be sponsored by Australian citizens or permanent residents to join them in Australia for a temporary or permanent stay under this visa category.</p>
		  
          <p><strong>Contributory Parent- </strong>There are several visa tracks or migration schemes that are part of the contributing parent visa. You can remain in Australia as a permanent resident by submitting an application for this visa. However, you must pass the balance-of-family test—that is, have half of your children living as legal residents or citizens of Australia—in order to be eligible for this visa.</p>
          <p>A letter of support is also required if you want a permanent visa under the previously indicated category. Those who apply for the Retirement Pathway are not required to do the same.</p>
          <p><strong>Sponsored Parent</strong>- In order to assist parents or grandparents in joining their children in Australia, a temporary visa category was introduced in March 2019. A parent may reside in Australia for up to five years under the visa pathway; however, the parent must leave the country for at least ninety days prior to reapplying for the visa.</p>
          <p><strong>Aged Parent Visa-</strong> Older parents who want to go to Australia with their children who are already citizens or residents of Australia are awarded the visa. Prior to applying for this visa, the prospective parents must have their children's sponsorship.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p><strong>Parent Visa Eligibility Requirements</strong></p>
          <p>In order to qualify for an Australia Parent visa, you have to:</p>
          <ul>
		    <li>Be sponsored by an eligible child, who is already settled in Australia as resident or citizen.</li>
			<li>Parents who are applying as a retiree do not need any sponsor for this visa</li>
			<li>Meet the balance-of-family test, which means half of your children must be lawfully living in Australia.</li>
			<li>Be able to obtain an assurance of support.</li>
			<li>Meet the health and character requirements.</li>
			<li>Have cleared all your debts with the government of Australia, in case you have.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>The cost of an Australia parent visa could reach AUD6,415, and there will not be any extra fees for each family member applying with you.<br />
            &nbsp;</p>
          <p><strong>Child Visa (Subclass 101)</strong></p>
          <p>Unlike children born in Australia, children born outside of the country to permanent residents or Australian citizens do not automatically become citizens. In this case, the parent is required to file for a subclass 101 Child Visa.</p>	  
<p>A child visa is available to anyone under the age of 25. Additionally, the potential child needs to stay outside of Australia while their visa application is being processed.
&nbsp;</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p><strong>Child Visa Categories:</strong></p>
          <p>Basically, there are three types of child visas:<br />
            &nbsp;</p>
			
			<p><strong>Adoption (Subclass 102):</strong> This is a permanent residence visa for a child under the age of eighteen who was not born in Australia but has been adopted by an Australian citizen or permanent resident, or a citizen of New Zealand who meets the requirements, or who is in the process of being adopted.</p>
			
<p><strong>Orphan Relative Visa (Subclass 117/Subclass 837):</strong> This type of visa permits an international orphan child (under the age of eighteen) to reside in Australia with family members. In order to be eligible to apply for this visa, the child's parents must be deceased, disabled, or missing.</p>

<p><strong>Dependent Child Visa (Subclass 445):</strong> This stream applies to children whose parents are in the process of applying for permanent residency but currently have a temporary partner visa.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p><strong>Basic Conditions for a Child Visa:</strong></p>
          <p>In order to qualify for an Australian child visa, you need to:</p>
          <ul>
		    <li>Be reliant on sponsored parents who are eligible citizens of New Zealand or permanent residents of Australia.</li>
			<li>The child must be younger than 25 years old or older than 18 years old.</li>
			<li>Have no spouse or be in a de facto relationship.</li>
			<li>Must fulfill the requirements for health and morality in addition to having parents apply for this visa.</li>
			<li>Be the parent's biological, adopted, or stepchild who is in possession of a temporary partner visa.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p><strong>Different Family Visa</strong></p>
          <p>For dependant relatives, caretakers, and other relatives of Australian and New Zealand residents and citizens, additional family visa options have been established:
		  </p>
          <ul>
		    <li>The potential candidate needs to have a relative who is an eligible New Zealand citizen, permanent resident, or Australian citizen sponsor them.</li>
			<li>The candidate needs to provide enough proof of their Australian connection.</li>
			<li>Need to give a support guarantee.</li>
			<li>Fulfill the standards for character and health.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p><strong>Important Aspects of the Different Family Visa:</strong></p>
          <ul>
		    <li>This visa allows the bearer unrestricted work and study privileges in Australia.</li>
			<li>Enjoy the benefits of social security and health care services.</li>
			<li>May file for Australian citizenship following a predetermined amount of time.</li>
			<li>Encourage others to move here permanently.</li>
          </ul>
