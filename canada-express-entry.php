<div class='text-justify innerpage-text'><p>These days, moving to Canada is simple, and you can stay and work there for a very long time because to the Canada Express Entry system. All skilled workers seeking high-paying employment apply for permanent residence through the Federal Skilled Worker Program, Federal Skilled Trades Program, or Canada Experience Class, three federal economic immigration programs.</p>
<p>The Canada Express Entry program, which was introduced in 2015, is essentially an online immigration system that handles applications from skilled professionals seeking permanent residence in Canada. The immigration system is structured to be competitive, ranking all eligible candidates against one another before inviting them to apply for the opportunity to get <a href="permanent-resident-canada.php" target="_blank">permanent resident status in Canada</a>.</p>

<h2>What is the system of Express Entry?</h2>
<p>For talented professionals, Canada Express Entry (EEP) is a fast-track immigration process leading to permanent residency. Under this system, candidates are ranked against each other according to selection criteria like age, work history, educational background, English or French language proficiency, and other factors like prearranged employment and a sincere desire to reside and build a business in any province in Canada.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>How Does Express Entry for Immigration to Canada Operate?</h2>
</div>
<p><strong>STEP 1 -</strong> In order to do this, you must complete an online express entry form with information on your age, nationality, language proficiency, family, education, employment history, and any job offers you may have received.</p>
<p><strong>STEP 2 -</strong> Simply make sure you are eligible for Canada Express entry by keeping all of your documentation, including language exams, up to date. The candidate receives a Job Seeker Validation code and an Express Entry Profile number after submitting their application to the pool. The applicant can create their resume in the Canada Job Bank by using both of these.</p>
<p><strong>STEP 3 -</strong> You will be placed in the Express Entry pool according to a points-based system once you have completed all the requirements. The data you submitted in the profile will be the basis for this score.</p>
<p><strong>STEP 4 -</strong> The top scorers receive an invitation to submit an application for permanent residency. Should you send an ITA, you will need to submit your application within 90 days.</p>
<h2>Express Entry Eligibility for Canada</h2>
<p>You must receive a minimum of 67 <a href="canada-pr-point-system.php" target="_blank"> Canada express entry points</a> which are determined by your age, education, work experience, possession of a valid job offer, proficiency in the English and/or French language, and adaptabilityâ€”in order to be eligible to apply for express entry. Based on the grid used to analyze the point, these scores are out of 100.</p>
<p>Points will be awarded according to your performance on these six selection criteria, which determine your eligibility for any of the three main federal economic initiatives.</p>
